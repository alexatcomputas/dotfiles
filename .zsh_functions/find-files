# Description: Recursively searches for files matching a given pattern within a specified directory depth.

# Arguments:
#   $1 (required): The search pattern (glob-style) for file names.
#   $2 (optional): The maximum depth for the recursive search (defaults to 1, the current directory).

# Usage:
#   find_files "*.txt"                # Find all .txt files in the current directory.
#   find_files "report*.pdf" 3        # Find all PDF files starting with "report" up to 3 levels deep.

# Output:
#   - Prints the executed 'find' command for transparency.
#   - Prints a "Searching..." message for user feedback.
#   - Lists the matching files (one per line), including their full paths.

# Notes:
#   - The search pattern uses glob-style matching, not regular expressions.
#   - The search is case-insensitive by default due to the '-iname' option.

find-files() {
    local search_pattern="$1"
    local path_depth="${2:-1}"

    print "Searching for '$search_pattern' (max depth: $path_depth)..."

    # Handle files matching the search pattern, including hidden files
    find -L -maxdepth "$path_depth" \
        \( -type f -iname "*$search_pattern*" \) \
        -not -name "." -not -name ".."  # Exclude "." and ".."
}
